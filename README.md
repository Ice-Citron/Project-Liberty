This will be my newest project, where I aim to type out famous code repositories via VS Code's Typing-Test extension so that the plan is that I can not only learn to type code faster, but I can also learn about the intricacies of various code repo's coding techniques. All repos that's copied manually by me will be included below.

The core idea is that I personally tend to can't get myself to crack-on and start learning/reading about an interesting research paper or established F.O.S.S. Github-Repositories, as I often find just reading code giving me a headache, as I fail to pace myself correctly. Hence, I have started this project as a means to curb this issue, and I've found it a great way to semi-procrastinate but also learn a lot in the process. Most importantly, I feel that this have re-sharpened my coding skills (by coding out thousands of lines a day by hand again), as all the vibe-coding of utilising Claude Code and GPT-5 Pro have been quite the "AI-brainrot" (I feel like I am losing the ability to code normally as a programmer again).
