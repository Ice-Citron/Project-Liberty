    "\n",
    "2. THE CONDITION: \"SELF-CMPLEMENTARY\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem states that $G$ is isomorphic to $\\overline{G}$. In our analogy, \n",

    "THE BOX ($\\overline{G}$).\n",

    "\n",
    "STEP 1: CALCULATE THE \"WHOLE PIZZA\" (TOTAL POSSIBLE EDGES)\n",

    "     the smaller loop formed by that touch-point. (Again, simplifying the \n",
    "     problem to a simple ring).\n",
    "\n",
    "   - \"SUPPOSE THAT $n$ AND $N'$ ARE ADJACENT...\"  \n",
    "   - TRANSLATION: This is the final check. We coloured everything based on #\n",
    "     distance. Now we check: Do any neighbours have the same colour?\n",
    "   - If $n$ and $n'$ are neighbours, their distances from the start must differ\n",
