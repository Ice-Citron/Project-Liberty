    "    - The Metaphor: Solving a maze. You keep walking down a path until you hit a\n",
    "      dead end, then you walk back to the last junction and try the other path.\n",
    "    - Data Structur: STACK (or RECURSION, which uses the system call stack).\n",
    "    - LECTURE EXAMPLE:\n",
    "        - Start at 1. Go to neighbour 2.\n",
    "        - From 2, immediately go deeper to 3.\n",
    "        - From 3, go to... dead end? Backtrack to 2.\n",
    "        - From 2, go down to 4.\n",
