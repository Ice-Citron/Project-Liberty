    "KEY CHARACTERISTICS & APPLICATIONS:\n",
    "   - STRUCTURE: Unlike binary trees, each node has up to four children. Nodes\n",
    "     represent a rectangular region, storing data points or pointers to\n",
    "     sub-regions.\n",
    "   - RECURSIVE SUBDIVISION: A region is split into four equal quadrants until\n",
    "     a subdivisiion criterion is met (e.g., maximum depth, maximum points per\n",
    "     node).\n",
    "   - USAGE: Commonly used for image representation, mesh egenration, spatial\n",
    "     database indexing (e.g., finding nearby points), and computer graphics.\n",
    "   - LINEAR QUADTREES: These can be represented without pointers, using codes to\n",
    "     represent nodes, saving significant memory.\n",
    "   - VARIANTS: A similar 3D structure is the OCTREE (8 children).\n",
    "\n",
    "   Quadtrees provide $O(log n)$ efficiency for many spatial queries and are more\n",
    "   effective than simple linear arrays for, for example, 2D data partitioning."

    "1. THE \"STEP-BY-STEP\" LOGIC\n",
    "    In algorithm analysis, we don't just look at the start and the end; we look\n",
    "    at what happens at each increment $i$.\n",
    "       - STEP 1 (Processing $x_2$) happens first. After Step 1 is finished, the\n",

    "   Insertion sort always maintains a \"sorted wall.\" Even before you do any work,\n",
    "   the very first element ($x_n$ in your notes) is technically a \"sorted \n",
    "   sublist\" of size 1.\n",

    "   - STEP A: First, you recursively sort the first $n - 1$ elements. This work\n",
    "     is represented as $W(n - 1)$.\n",
    "   - STEP B: Once you have a sorted pile of $n - 1$ items, you take the very\n",
    "     last element (the $n$-th one) and find where it belongs in that pile.\n",

    "2. THE BINARY SEARCH \"COST\"\n",

    "   comparisons (if the element is the absolute minimum).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - However, Binary Search is much more efficient. To search through a sorted\n",
    "     array of size $k$, it only takes $\\lceil \\log_2(k+1) \\rceil$ comparisons.\n",
    "   - Since our sorted pile is size $n - 1$, the search for the $n$-th element\n",
    "     costs at most $\\lceil log_2(n) \\rceil$ comparisons.\n",
    "\n",

    "3. THE RECURRENCE RELATION\n",
    "   Combining those two steps gives you the total work formula:\n",
