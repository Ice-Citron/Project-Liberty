    "KEY CHARACTERISTICS & APPLICATIONS:\n",
    "   - STRUCTURE: Unlike binary trees, each node has up to four children. Nodes\n",
    "     represent a rectangular region, storing data points or pointers to\n",
    "     sub-regions.\n",
    "   - RECURSIVE SUBDIVISION: A region is split into four equal quadrants until\n",
    "     a subdivisiion criterion is met (e.g., maximum depth, maximum points per\n",
    "     node).\n",
    "   - USAGE: Commonly used for image representation, mesh egenration, spatial\n",
    "     database indexing (e.g., finding nearby points), and computer graphics.\n",
    "   - LINEAR QUADTREES: These can be represented without pointers, using codes to\n",
    "     represent nodes, saving significant memory.\n",
    "   - VARIANTS: A similar 3D structure is the OCTREE (8 children)."
