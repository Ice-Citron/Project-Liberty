    "   It is totally normal to feel like you've been thrown into the deep end here.\n",
    "   Moving from high-level concepts (like knowing what an ALU is) to actually\n",
    "   seeing the specific 32-bit physical wiring blueprints (which is what assembly\n",
    "   formats really are) is a huge jump.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Think of these \"Types\" as different puzzle templates. You only have exactly\n",
    "   32 bits of space to tell the CPU what to do. Depending on the task, you have\n",
    "   to chop those 32 bits up differently to fit the required pieces.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. U-Type (Upper Immediate)\n",
    "   THE CONCEPT: I-Type instructions only give you 12 bits of space to store a\n",
    "   constant number. But what if you need to load a 32-bit number into a register\n",
    "   ? You have to do it in two chunks. The U-Type handles the massive top chunk.\n",
    "\n",
    "   THE BLUEPRINT: It dedicates a whopping 20 bits purely to storing a number\n",
    "   (`imm[31:12]`), along with a destination register (`rd`) and the `opcode`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ASSEMBLY EXAMPLE:\n",
    "```Assembly\n",
    "lui x10, 0x87654        # \"Load Upper Immediate\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "   - WHAT IT DOES: It takes the hex number `0x1a65f` (4 bits * 5 placeholders... make sense!)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. S-Type (Store)\n",
    "\n",
    "   THE CONCEPT: This is the exact opposite of Load. You have calculated an\n",
    "   answer in your CPU registers, and now you need to safely store it away in the\n",
    "   RAM (memory).\n",
    "\n",
    "   THE BLUEPRINT: Notice in the image that S-Type DOES NOT HAVE A DESTINATION\n",
    "   REGISTER (`rd`). Why? Because the destination isn't a register; it's the RAM!\n",
    "   Instead, it uses two source registers (`rs1` and `rs2`) and splits the \n",
    "   12-bit immediate into two weird chunks (`imm[11:5]` and `imm[4:0]`). It\n",
    "   splits the immediate so that `rs1` and `rs2` can stay in the exact same\n",
    "   physical wire positions as they do in R-Type instructions, which makes the\n",
    "   hardware engineers' lives easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ASSEMBLY EXAMPLE:\n",
    "```Assembly\n",
    "sd x14, 8(x2)           # \"Store Doubleword\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "   - WHAT IT DOES: It takes the data currently sitting in register `x14` (which\n",
    "     acts as `rs2`) and stores it into the memory address calculated by taking\n",
    "     the base address in `x2` (`rs1`) and adding an offset of `8`.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. B-Type (Branch)\n",
    "\n",
    "   THE CONCEPT: This is your assembly-level `if-statement`. It compares two\n",
    "   registers, and if a condition is met, it \"branches\" (jumps) to a different\n",
    "   line of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "   THE BLUEPRINT: It looks almost identical to the S-Type. It uses two source\n",
    "   registers (`rs1` and `rs2`) to compare values. The \"immediate\" here is the\n",
    "   offset (how many steps to jump forward or backward). You'll notice the\n",
    "   immediate bits arte scrambled like crazy (`imm[12]`, `imm[10:5]`, \n",

    "   THE BLUEPRINT: Because you might need to jump really far away in your code,\n",

    "THE BLUEPRINT\n",
    "   To jump to a new location, the CPU needs two things: the destination address\n",
    "   and a way to get back. The 32 bits are divided as follows:\n",
    "   - OPCODE (7 bits): Identifies the instruction as a J-type jump.\n",
    "   - RD (5 bits): The \"Link\" register. Before the CPU jumps away, it saves the\n",
    "     address of the next instruction here so the program knows where to return\n",
    "     when the function ends.\n",
    "   - IMMEDIATE (20 bits): This is the \"jump distance\".\n",

    "---\n",
    "THE SCRAMBLED IMMEDIATE\n",
    "   You might notice in your lecture summary that the bits for the immediate\n",
    "   (`imm[20]`, `imm[10:1]`, `imm[11]`, `imm[19:12]`) are in a very strange, \n",
    "   non-linear order.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - WHY? This is a hardware optimisation. By placing certain bits in specific\n",
    "     spots, the physical wires for the `opcode` and `rd` can stay in the same\n",

    "HOW IT WORKS STEP-BY-STEP:\n",
    "   1. CALCULATE RETURN ADDRESS: The CPU looks at the current PROGRAM COUNTER \n",
    "      (PC) and adds 4 (the address of the very next line of code).\n",
    "   2. LINK: It saves that return address into register `x1`.\n",
    "   3. JUMP: It takes the scrambled 20-bit immediate, \"unscrambles\" it, and adds\n",
    "      it to the current PC.   \n",
    "   4. EXECUTE: The CPU starts executing the code at that new address.\n",
    "\n",
    "SUMMARY OF J-TYPE FEATURES:\n",
    "   - UNCONDITIONAL: It always jumps; it doesn't compare registers like a B-type\n",
    "     (Branch) instruction.\n",
    "   - RANGE: Because it has 20 bits for the offset, it can jump much further than\n",
    "     a B-type instruction (which only has 12 bits). \n",
    "   - SAVES PROGRESS: It is designed for subroutines/functions because it \"links\"\n",
    "     (saves) the return path."
