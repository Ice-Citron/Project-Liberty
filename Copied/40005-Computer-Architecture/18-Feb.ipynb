    "1. MODULE OVERVIEW && STRUCTURE\n",
    "   The module is split into two halves, exploring the two major philosophoies\n",
    "   of processor design:\n",
    "   - PART 1 (Lecture 1-9): Focuses on RISC-V (Reduced Instruction Set Computer).\n",
    "     This is an elegant, modern, and open-source architecture that uses simple,\n",
    "     fixed-length (32-bit) instructions.\n",
    "   - PART 2 (Lecture 10 onwards): Focuses on CISC (Complex Instruction Set\n",
    "     Computer), specifically looking at Intel/AMD's x86 architecture (which is\n",
    "     likely what powers your laptop).\n",
    "   - THE CORE TEXTBOOK: ...\n",

    "---\n",
    "2. BRIDGING YOUR C/C++ KNOWLEDGE TO HARDWARE\n",
    "   \n",
    "THE ISA (Instruction to Set Architecture)\n",
    "   The ISA is the bridge or \"API\" between your C++ software and the physical\n",
    "   hardware.\n",
    "   - CISC (x86): Has thousands of complex instructions. For example, doing \n",
    "     complex math might be a simple hardware instruction. Great for dense code,\n",
    "     but extremely complex to build in hardware.\n",
    "   - RISC (RISC-V): Has very few, simple instructions. Your C++ compiler has to \n",
    "     break your code down into many simple steps, but because they are simple,\n",
    "     the hardware can execute them incredibly fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "TRANSLATING C++ TO RISC-V (Load/Store Architecture)\n",
    "   - REGISTERS: RISC-V has 32 general-purpose registers (`x0` to `x31`). Think\n",
    "     of them as ultra-fast, temporary hardware variables living directly on the\n",
    "     CPU.\n",
    "   - LOAD/STORE: You cannot do math directly on RAM memory. If you have\n",
    "     `int a = b + c;` in memory, the CPU must first exactly `load` `b` and `c`\n",
    "     into registers, do the math in the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit), and then\n",
    "     `store` the result back to `a`. (When you dereference a pointer in C++, you\n",
    "     are explicitly triggering these Load/Store hardware instructions).\n",
    "   - HARDWARE QUIRKS: Register `x0` is hardwired to the constant value `0`. If\n",
    "     your code tries to write to it, the hardware physically ignroes it. \n",
    "     Register `x1` is the return address (used when your C++ functions `return`)\n",
    "     . Furhtermore, RISC-V doesn't even have a native \"COPY\" instruction! To \n",
    "     copy a variable, the compiler simply tells the CPU to `ADD` `x0` (zero) to\n",
    "     the first register and save it in the new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. EXPLICIT EXAM && ASSESSMENT TIPS FROM THE LECTURER\n",
    "   Your lecturer dropped several explicit hints about what will be tested and \n",
    "   how you should study:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. YOU DO NOT NEED TO DEFINE A \"Datapath\" (but you must identify it visually)\n",
    "      - Lecturer's quote: \"You will not [be asked] to explain what a data path\n",
    "        is in your exam. So don't worry about it. BUT WHENEVER YOU SEE A DATA\n",
    "        PASS, YOU MUST BE ABLE TO IDENTIY THAT.\"\n",
    "      - What this means: You will be shown massive, complex block diagrams of \n",
    "        wires and boxes (Registers, ALUs, Multiplexers). Don't memorise the\n",
    "        dictionary definition; instead, practice visually tracing your finger \n",
    "        how data flows from the memory, through the registers, and into the ALU.\n",
    "   2. CONTROL UNITS WILL BE IN THE EXAM:\\\n",
    "      - Lecturer's quote: \"In terms of designing control units, we must be\n",
    "        extremely careful.\" WE WILL MEET SOME DESIGNING PROBLEMS IN OUR \n",
    "        TUTORIALS AND QUIZZES AND ALSO EXAMS.\"\n",
    "      - What this means: The Control Unit is the \"manager\" of the CPU that sends\n",
    "        signals to open/close paths. You will be asked to design or troubleshoot\n",
    "        the logic for a control unit when it encounters exceptions \n",
    "        (errors/crashes).\n",
    "   3. COURSEWORK STRATEGY - DO NOT REVERSE-ENGINEER:\n",
    "      - Lecturer's quote: \"It's totally different between trying to answer the\n",
    "        questions yourself and then... seeing the solutions and then reverse\n",
    "        engineer how it works.\"\n",
    "      - WHAT THIS MEANS: Attempt the tutorial sheets blind before the solutions\n",
    "        release a week later. The exam tests your active design process, not\n",
    "        your ability to read a finished diagram. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "4. CORE CONCEPT: THE \"PERFORMANCE\" EQUATION\n",
    "\n",
    "   In computer architecture, \"performance\" purely means SPEED (EXECUTION TIME).\n",
    "   A massive chunk of Lecture 2 resolve around around calculating CPU\n",
    "   performance. You will use this golden equation constantly:\n",
    "\n",
    "      EXECUTION TIME = INSTRUCTION COUNT \\times CPI (Cyles Per Instructions)\n",
    "         \\times CLOCK CYCLE TIME        \n",
    "\n",
    "   - INSTRUCTION COUNT: Dictated by your C/C++ algorithm (e.g., $O(n)$ vs\n",
    "     $O(n^2)$) and how smart your compiler is.\n",
    "   - CPI: Dictated by the architecture. RISC-V executes more instructions than\n",
    "     CISC overall, but its incredibly low (often close to 1 cycle per \n",
    "     instruction), making it fundamentally fast. C++ `if/else` statements cause\n",
    "     branching, which forces the CPU to wait to see which path to take,\n",
    "     increasing your average CPI.\n",
    "   - CYCLE TIME: Dictated by the physical hardware (e.g., a 4GHz clock speed).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "5. VISUAL TOOLS && SOFTWARE NUDGES (Highly Recommended)\n",
    "   Computer architecture is notoriously difficult to learn just by staring at\n",
    "   text and block diagrams (the lecturer admitted that tracing datapath diagrams\n",
    "   is the \"ugly part\" of managing complexity). Because you learn better visually\n",
    "   and practically, you MUST use these tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. PLAY WITH \"COMPILER EXPLORER\" (Web)\n",
    "      - WHY: Since you known C++, the gap between C++ and Assembly can feel \n",
    "        abstract.\n",
    "      - ACTION: Go to `godbolt.org`. Type a simple C++ `for` loop or `if`\n",
    "        statement on the left, and set the compiler on the right to \n",
    "        `RISC-V (rv32g)`. You will see exactly how your C++ trasnslates into\n",
    "        RISC-V instructions (`beq`, `bne`, `addi`, `lw`, `sw`) line-by-line.\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. INSTALL \"Venus\" OR \"RARS\" (RISC-V Simulators)        \n",
    "      - WHY: You will be writing RISC-V assembly code soon. Doing this on paper\n",
    "        is awful.\n",
    "      - ACTION: Go to the web-based VENUS RISC-V SIMULATOR or download RARS. \n",
    "        These tools let you write assembly code, click \"Step,\" and visually\n",
    "        watch your data move into registers (`x0-x31`) and memory step-by-step.\n",
    "        It turns abstract concepts into an interactive visual debugger.\n",
    "\n",
    "   3. YouTube Nudge: Visualise the Datapath\n",
    "      - WHY: Staring at static slides of a datapath is overwhelming.\n",
    "      - ACTION: Search YouTube for \"RISC-V Single Cycle Datapath Animation\".\n",
    "        Seeing the data \"light up\" graphically as it flows from the Instruction\n",
    "        Memory --> Registers --> ALU --> Data Memory will make the diagrams\n",
    "        \"click\" instantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "   4. YouTube Nudge: TPUs and Systolic Arrays\n",
    "      - WHY: In Lecture 1, the lecturer talks about Google's TPU (Tensor \n",
    "        Processing Unit) and SYSTOLIC ARRAYS used for AI and LLMs. This\n",
    "        sounds terrifyingly complex, but it's just a grid of ALUs pumping data\n",
    "        like a conveyor belt (hence systolic, like a heartbeat).\n",
    "      - ACTION: Search YouTube for \"Systolic Array Matmul Animation.\" Seeing the\n",
    "        numbers physically flow from left to right and top to bottom in a \n",

    "   WHAT ARE THEY?\n",
    "      Pseudo-ops are \"fake\" instructions. They are commands that you (the\n",

    "      processor hardware does not actually know how to do them directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "   WHY DO THEY EXIST?\n",
    "      Your processor follows the RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) \n",

    "            1. `lui` (Load Upper Immediate): Loads the top half of the number.\n",
