    "\n",
    "... dropped several hints about what matters for the exam (and what doesn't).\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. \"THINK OF MATRIX MULTIPLICATION AS FUNCTION COMPOSITION\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - The Tip: He says, \"Suddenly all the properties... make sense.\"\n",
    "    - Exam Application: If you get a True/False question like: \"Is $AB = BA$?\",\n",
    "      don't try to multply matrices in your head. Just ask: \n",
    "      \"Is $f(g(x)) = g(f(x))$?\" Usually no (putting socks then shows $\\new$ \n",
    "      shoes then socks).\n",
    "    - WHY: He explicitly said he \"doesn't like to teach it\" as row-by-column\n",
    "      multiplication. He prefers the function view. Expect conceptual questions\n",
    "      on this.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. THE \"DETERMINANT AS AREA\" HINT\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The Tip: He mentions: \"The area of this image would be determinant of A\n",
    "      times [original area].\"\n",
    "    - EXAM APPLICATION: You might get a question asking for the area of a \n",
    "      transformed shape (e.g., a parallelogram).\n",
    "    - STRATEGY: Don't do integration or geometry. Just calculate $det(A)$ and\n",
    "      multiply it by the original area (uually 1 for a unit square).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. \"TIME COMPLEXITY\" (HOMEWORK)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - THE TIP: \"As an exercise, I would like you to analyse the Gaussian \n",
    "      elimination algorithm and tell me its time complexity.\"\n",
    "    - ACTION: DO THIS. This is a classic \"exam question in disguise.\"\n",
    "    - THE ANSWER: It is roughly $O(n^3)$ (specifically $2/3 * n^3$). Memorize \n",
    "      this.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. THE \"TUTORIAL SHEET\" MMT...\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ...\n",
    "    - ... If you can solve those questions using the \"Free Variable\" method he\n",
    "      showed (writing solutions as $x_p + \\lambda v_1 + \\mu v_2$), you are safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    5. \"REDUCED ROW ECHELON FORM\" vs. \"ROW ECHELON FORM\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    - THE TIP: He admits REF is often enough, but says \"I think it's preferred\n",
    "      that you go all the way down to the reduced row echelon.\"\n",
    "    - EXAM ADVICE: Unless time is critical, always go to RREF. It makes reading\n",
    "      the solution (and checking your work) much harder to mess up.    "
