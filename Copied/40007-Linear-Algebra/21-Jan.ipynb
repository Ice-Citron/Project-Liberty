    "1. \"WHEN WE HAVE FREE VARIABLES... THE DETERMINANT MUST BE ZERO?\"\n",
    "    - YES. (For a square matrix)\n",

    "2. \"WHICH SIMILARLY ALSO MEANS DIMENSION COLLAPSE?\"\n",

    "    - YES. This is the definition of LINEAR DEPENDENCE.\n",
    "    - Imagine your columns are three arrows: $u, v, w$.\n",
    "    - If they span 3D space, $w$ points in a totally new direction (up/out).\n",
