    "\n",
    "This is the practical part for your exams and coding.\n",

    "THE ALGORITHM:\n",
    "   1. Stack our vectors as COLUMNS in a matrix $A$.\n",
    "   2. Run Gaussian Elimination to get Row Echelon Form (REF).\n",
    "   3. CHECK FOR PIVOTS:\n",
    "         - EVERY COLUMN HAS A PIVOT: ---> LINEARLY INDEPENDENT. (Unique solution)\n",

    "WHY THIS WORKS (Game Dev Analogy):\n",
    "   - Think of Pivots as \"New Dimensions Unlocked.\"\n",
    "   - COLUMN 1: Pivot! (Unlocked X-axis).\n",
    "   - COLUMN 2: Pivot! (Unlocked Y-axis).\n",
    "   - COLUMN 3: No Pivot?\n",
    "      - This means Column 3 didn't unlock Z. It just retraced steps on X and Y.\n",

    "4. EXAM TIPS (FROM THE LECTURER)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The \"Homogeneous\" Subspace Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "   - EXAM TIP: \"Solution to a HOMOGENEOUS system ($Ax = 0$) is a SUBSPACE.\"\n",
    "   - EXAM TIP: \"Solution to a NON-HOMOGENEOUS system ($Ax = b, b \\neq 0$) is\n",
    "     NOT a subspace.\"\n",
    "   - Why: The non-homogeneous one is shifted away from the origin (like a plane\n",
    "     floating in space). It fails the \"Zero Vector\" check.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. THE \"500 VECTORS\" QUESTION\n",
    "\n",
    "   - EXAM TIP: If asked to check independence for a huge set of vectors (e.g.,\n",
    "     500 vectors in 800D space), do not try to guess.\n",
    "   - THE ANSWER: \"Use Gaussian Elimination. Check for pivots.\"\n",
    "   - Why? He explicitly said, \"What if you are given 500 different vectors...\n",
    "     that's a difficult task. But there is an algorithm... Gaussian Elimination.\n",
    "     \"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. \"VISUAL INSPECTION\" vs. \"ALGORITHM\"\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - EXAM TIP: If the vectors are simple (e.g., $[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]$),\n",
    "     you don't need Gaussian Elimination. You can just \"see\" they are \n",
    "     independent.\n",
    "   - However: If the question asks to \"Show\" or \"Prove\", write out the Gaussian\n",
    "     steps or the determinant calculation to be safe.  \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "4. THE \"INVERSE\" CONENCTION \n",
    "\n",
    "   - EXAM TIP: Gaussian Elimination does 3 things:\n",
    "      1. Solves linear equations ($Ax = b$)\n",
    "      2. Computes inverse ($A^{-1}$)\n",
    "      3. Checks Linear Independence (Pivots)\n",
    "    - Expect a question that links these. E.g., \"Use Gaussian Elimination to \n",
    "      find the inverse. If it fails, what does that say about the linear\n",
    "      independence of the columns?\" (Answer: They are dependent.)  "
