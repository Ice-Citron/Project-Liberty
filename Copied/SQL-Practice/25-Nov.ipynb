    "- Question: Is `NULL` equal to `NULL`?\n",
    "- Logic: \"I don't know what the first value is, and I don't know what the second\n",
    "  value is. So I cannot say they are equal.\"\n",

    "- The symbol `<>` is the standard SQL operator for **\"Not Equal To.\"**\n",
    "  - It means exactly the same thing as `!=`.\n",
    "  - You read it as: \"Less than or greater than\" (which implies \"anything except\n",
    "    equal\").\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The Logic Trap\n",
    "- In standard boolean logic, the statement \"X is equal to Y OR X is not equal to\n",
    "  Y\" is a tautology--it's always true.\n",

    "- Let's look at the two parts of the `WHERE` clause:\n",
    "  1. `rate = NULL`:\n",
    "    - As we discussed, comparing anything to `NULL` results in UNKNOWN.\n",
    "  2. `rate <> NULL`:\n",
    "    - SQL asks: \"Is this value different from an unknown value?\"\n",
    "    - Answer: \"I don't know.\" (It results in UNKNOWN).\n",
