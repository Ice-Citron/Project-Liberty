    "The lecturer gave specific advice on how to write these proofs for the exam:\n",
    "   1. BE VERBOSE: Do not just write lines of math. You must justify every step.\n",
    "      - Bad: \"Since $p$ is true, $p \\vee q$ is true.\"\n",
    "      - Good: \"Since $|p|_v = tt, then $|p \\vee q|_v = tt BY THE SEMANTICS OF\n",

    "   2. REASONING: The phrase \"By the semantics of IMPLICATION/AND/OR\" is your\n",
    "      \"get out of jail free\" card. Use it repeatedly to justify why you moved\n",
    "      from one step to the next.\n",
    "   3. NATURAL DEDUCTION: He hinted that \"Natual Deduction\" (coming in future\n",
    "      lectures) is usually an exam question. Direct Argument is the foundation\n",

    "   - VERSATILE: Can check validity, satisfiability, and equivalence all at once.\n",

    "        , satisfiability and equivalence, etc. can be--even for 'trivial'\n",
    "        propositional logic. (Adding an atom doubles the length of the table.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- CONS:\n",
    "   - EXPONENTIAL EXPLOSION: Adding just one more atom doubles the table size\n",
    "     ($2^n$ rows).\n",
    "      - 2 atoms  = 4 rows\n",
    "      - 3 atoms  = 8 rows\n",
    "      - 10 atoms = 1024 rows  \n",
    "   - \"DUMB\" and \"TEDIOUS\": It requires no clever reasoning, just brute force\n",
    "     calculation, which makes it error-prone for humans.\n",
    "   - NP-COMPLETE: The slide notes that determining satisfiability is \n",
    "     computationally hard (NP-complete), meaning for large systems, computers\n",

    "1. SATISFIABILITY\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Your Question: \"is it because since satisfiability only require AT LEAST ONE scenario... yet we have ALL scenarios true. hence both true???\"\n",
    "\n",
    "YES. \n",
    "   - THE BAR: Satisfiability is a low bar. It just asks: \"Is it possible for \n",
    "     this to be true?\" (Is there $\\geq 1$ `tt`?).\n",
    "   - THE RESULT: You have 4 `tt`s.\n",
    "   - THE VERDICT: If you are perfect (Valid), you are definitely \"good enough\"\n",
    "     (Satisfiable).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. EQUIVALENCE (THE \"MATCHING\" NUANCE)\n",
    "\n",
    "   Your Question: \"is equivalence true because in all scenarios they are all true?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "CAREFUL HERE. Equivalence does NOT mean the two formulas are \"always true.\" It\n",
    "means they are \"ALWAYS IN SYNC.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Look closely at the table in the slide:\n",
    "   - Look at the column for $(p \\rightarrow q)$: It has values `tt, ff, tt, tt`.\n",
    "   - Look at the column for $(\\neg p \\vee q)$: It has values `tt, ff, tt, tt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "WHY ARE THEY EQUIVALENT?\n",
    "   - They are equivalent because those two columns are IDENTICAL FINGERPRINTS.\n",
    "   - Notice the second row (where $p = tt, q = ff$). BOTH sides are `ff`.\n",
    "      - They are FALSE TOGETHER.\n",
    "      - Equivalence just requires them to agree. It doesn't care if they agree\n",
    "        on being True or agree on being False, as long as they match.\n",
    "\n",
    "THE \"RED COLUMN\" CONNECTION:\n",
    "Because the two sides match perfectly, the \"Equivalence Checker\" (the \n",
    "$\\leftrightarrow$ in the final red column) outputs `tt` every single time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "SUMMARY\n",
    "   - SATISFIABILITY: \"I found at least one `tt`.\" (Pass)\n",
    "   - EQUIVALENCE: \"Side A and Side B behave exactly the same (even when they are\n",
    "     both False).\""

    "To do this, we usually:\n",

    "   2. Check if this forces the CONSEQUENT (Then-part) to be True.\n",

    "Here is the breakdown of the LAW OF EXCLUDED MIDDLE.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. THE CORE DEFINITION\n",
    "   - The Formula: $p \\vee \\neg p$\n",
    "   - The Translation: \"Either $p$ is True, or $\\neg p$ is True.\"\n",
    "   - The Rule: There is no third option. You cannot be \"sort of\" pregnant, and a\n",
    "     boolean variable cannot be \"kinda\" true.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. WHY IS IT CALLED \"EXCLUDED MIDDLE\"?\n",
    "   Imagine a line with two sides:\n",
    "   - Side A: True.\n",
    "   - Side B: False\n",
    "   - The Middle: Maybe/Unknown/Sort-of\n",
    "\n",
    "   This law takes that \"Middle\" section and DELETES IT. It \"excludes\" the \n",
    "   possibility of sitting on the fence.\n",
    "      - Example: \"It is raining.\"\n",
    "         - Logic says: Right now, it is either raining ($T$) or it is not \n",
    "           raining ($F$).\n",
    "         - EXCLUDED MIDDLE says: You cannot say \"Well, it is msiting, so it's\n",
    "           technically neither.\" Logic forces you to pick a bucket: Is \"mist\"\n",
    "           rain? Yes or No?\n",
