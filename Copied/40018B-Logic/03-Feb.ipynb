    "\n",
    "   - NOTATION MATTERS: The lecturer emphasized that you must be PRECISE WITH\n",
    "     NOTATION (e.g., line numbers, rule names). Imprecise notation can lose\n",
    "     you marks in the exam.\n",
    "   - FOLLOW THE STRUCTURE: Stick rigidly to the proof structure taught (e.g.,\n",
    "     `assume` on the first line of a box, $\\rightarrow I$ immediately after\n",
    "     closing a box). Deviating from this structure will be marked down.\n",
    "   - CONSECUTIVE LINE NUMBERS: While not strictly mandatory, the lecturer\n",
    "     strongly recommends using consecutive line numbers for clarity. If you mess\n",
    "     up the numbering, fix it or explain it clearly to avoid confusing the\n",
    "     m,arker.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. EXAM QUESTION PATTERNS\n",
    "   - NATURAL DEDUCTION QUESTION: There is \"almost always\" a question in the exam\n",
    "     asking you to prove the validity of an argument using Natural Deduction.\n",
    "   - STANDARD FORMAT: The question typically gives you a sequence \n",
    "     (premises $\\vdash conclusion$) and asks you to construct the proof.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. USING \"DERIVED RULES\" (SHORTCUTS)\n",
    "   - LAW OF EXCLUDED MIDDLE (LEM): The lecturer introduced $P \\vee \\neg P$ \n",
    "     (derived in the example without premises) as a DERIVED RULE.             <-- was this like the example that i did just\n",
    "                                                                                now? cuz tbf im still not really sure what does LEM look like in this case tbh...\n",
    "   - TIP: You are ALLOWED to use derived rules like LEM as shortcuts in this \n",
    "     course. This can make your proofs significantly shorter. You don't need to\n",
    "     re-prove them from scratch every time unless asked.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. HANDLING \"NO PREMISES\"\n",
    "   - STRATEGY: If you are given a sequent with no premises (e.g., \n",
    "     $\\vdash P \\vee \\neg P$), you MUST START BY MAKING AN ASSUMPTION.\n",
    "   - TIP: You can assume whatever you want (e.g., assume the negation of what\n",
    "     you're trying to prove to set up a contradiction).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. SCOPE & BOXES (Crucial Warning)\n",
    "   - SCOPE RULE: You CANNOT use a formula derived inside a box after that box\n",
    "     has closed. It is \"dead\" outside the box.\n",
    "   - EXCEPTION (NESTED BOXES): You CAN use formulas from an outer box inside an\n",
    "     inner box (because the outer assumption is still active).\n",
    "   - EXAM TIP: Be very careful with scope. Using a line from a closed box is a\n",
    "     common error that invalidates the proof.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. CONTRADICTION STRATEGY:\n",
    "   - \"FROM CONTRADICTION, ANYTHING FOLLOWS\": The lecturer reiterated that \n",
    "     syntactically, if you derive $\\bot$ (bottom), you can concluse any formula\n",
    "     $\\phi$. This is a powerful tool to escape dead ends in a proof.\n",
    "   - TIP: If you are stuck, try to find a contradiction. Once you have $\\bot$,\n",
    "     you can immediately write down the formula you are trying to prove (using\n",
    "     $\\bot E$)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. DOUBLE NEGATION\n",
    "   - TIP: Remember that $\\neg \\neg P$ and $P$ are interchangeable using the \n",
    "     double negation introduction/elimination rules. This is often a necessary\n",
    "     step when proving things involving LEM or reductio ad absurdum."

    "1. PRIMITIVE vs. DERIVED RULES (The \"Shortcut\" Concept)\n",
    "THE CONCEPT:\n",
    "   - PRIMITIVE RULES: These are the basic building blocks we defined earlier\n",
    "     ($\\wedge I$, $\\wedge E$, $\\rightarrow I$, $\\rightarrow E$). They are the\n",
    "     \"atoms\" of the proof system. They are independent--you cannot remove one\n",
    "     without breaking the system.\n",
    "   - DERIVED RULES: These are \"shortcuts.\" They are complex formulas that we\n",
    "     have already proven to be valid using primitive rules. Because we known \n",
    "     they work, we can just use them as a single step instead of writing out the \n",
    "     10-line proof every time.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ANALOGY:\n",
    "      - PRIMITIVE RULES: Writing code in Assembly Language (moving individual\n",
    "        bits in memory).\n",
    "      - DERIVED RULES: Calling a Python function. The function is built out of\n",
    "        Assembly eventually, but you just type `sort()` to save time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   LECTURER'S EXAM TIP:\n",
    "      \"Derived rules are NOT neccessary, but they do help to speed proofs up...\n",
    "      Some `purists` only allow for \"primitive rules\"... We don't here!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "      TAKEAWAY: You are ALLOWED and ENCOURAGED to use these shortcuts in the\n",
