    "   - THE \"ABSORPTION\" TRAP: The lecturer noted that students often missed the\n",
    "     ABSORPTION rule $p \\wedge (p \\vee q) \\equiv p$. Recognising this saves you\n",
    "     huge amounts of time. If you see a variable repeating inside and outside a\n",
    "     bracket, look for Absorption.\n",
    "   - JUSTIFICATION STYLE:\n",
    "      - Bad: Writing the math derivation without comments.\n",
    "      - Required: You MUST annotate every step.\n",
    "      - Example: Write \"$\\equiv \\neg p \\vee q$ (BY LOGICAL EQUIVALENCE OF IMPLICATION)\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   - NOTATION: Use the course symbols ($\\neg, \\wedge, \\vee$). Do not use code\n",
    "     symbols like `!`, `&`, `|` or you may lose marks.\n",
    "   - QUESTION PREDICTION: The lecturer explicitly said: \"There is typically a\n",
    "     question about [Distrbutivity/Normal Forms] in the exam.\" Expect a question\n",
    "     where you are given a messy formula and asked to convert it to DNF or CNF.  "

    "... the lecturer explicitly dedicate ... for solving equivalence proofs in your\n",
    "exams and courseworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the run-through of the key tips he emphasized:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. NAME THE EQUIVALENCE LAW EVERY TIME\n",
    "   - The Rule: You must specify which rule you are using for every single step \n",
    "     of your derivation (e.g., \"by De Morgan's Law\", \"by Distributivity\").\n",
    "   - The Lecturer's Advice:\n",
    "      - BEST CASE: Use the formal name (e.g., \"Idempotence\").\n",
    "      - ACCEPTABLE CASE: If you blank on the name during the exam, write down \n",
    "        what the rule does or the formula for it. He explicitly stated: \"If you\n",
    "        just say 'Look, I know I forgot the name, but I know that this is what\n",
    "        the rule means,' it's also fine.\"\n",
    "      - THE GOAL: Show that you understand the logic, not just that you #\n",
    "        memorised a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. APPLY ONE RULE AT A TIME\n",
    "   - THE RULE: Do not try to combine multiple steps into one line (e.g., don't\n",
    "     do De Mogran's AND Associativity in a single jump).\n",
    "   - THE LECTURER'S REASONING:\n",
    "      - ERROR PREVENTION: It is much easier to make a silly mistake when doing\n",
    "        two things at once.\n",
    "      - MARKING: It makes his life easier when grading. If he can't follow your\n",
    "        jump, you might lose marks. He explicitly said: \"Applying one rule at a \n",
    "        time makes my...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. DON'T IGNORE THE \"SIMPLE\" RULES\n",
    "   - THE RULE: You must reference even the basic strucutal rules like \n",
    "     ASSOCIATIVITY (moving brackets) and COMMUTATIVITY (swapping order).\n",
    "   - THE PITFALL: Students often think these are too obvious to mention. The\n",
    "     lecturer warns against this. If you move brackets, write \n",
    "     `[by assoscativity]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. BE \"ROBOTIC\"\n",
    "   - The Summary Tip: The lecturer advised trying to be \"as robotic as possible.\"     \n",
    "   - WHAT THIS MEANS: Remove all ambiguity. Write one line, write the \n",
    "     justification, write the next line, write the justification. It might feel\n",
    "     boring or tedious, but it is the safest way to ensure you get full marks\n",
    "     and pass the exam."

    "... LECTURE 5: NATURAL DEDUCTION, ...\n",
    "\n",
    "The lecture introduces the PROOF SYSTEM method for checking validity. Unlike\n",
    "truth tables (brute force) or equivalence (algebra), this method is like writing\n",
    "code: you follow strict syntactic rules to build a proof line-by-line.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. THE CORE CONCEPT: NATURAL DEDUCTION\n",
    "   - GOAL: Prove that a list of premises ($\\phi_1, \\dots, \\phi_n$) logically\n",
    "     forces a conclusion ($\\psi$) to be true.\n",
    "   - NOTATION: $\\phi_1, \\dots, \\phi_n \\vdash \\psi$ (This whole expression is \n",
    "     caleld a SEQUENT).\n",
    "   - METHOD: We use INFERENCE RULES. For every logical operator (like \n",
    "     $\\wedge, \\rightarrow$), there are exactly two types of rules:\n",
    "        1. INTRODUCTION ($I$): How to create a formula with this operator.\n",
    "        2. ELIMINATION ($E$): How to use (break down) a formula with this \n",
    "           operator.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. RULES FOR CONJUNCTION ($\\wedge$)\n",
    "These are the simplest rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "A. INTRODUCTION ($\\wedge I$)\n",
    "   - LOGIC: If you know $A$ is true, and you know $B$ is true, you can conclude\n",
    "     $A \\wedge B$.\n",
    "   - SYNTAX:\n",
    "      1. $\\phi$... (proven earlier)\n",
    "      2. $\\psi$... (proven earlier)\n",
    "      3. $\\phi \\wedge \\psi$ $\\wedge I(1, 2)$  \n",

    "   - SYNTAX (The Box):\n",
    "      - You open a BOX (a sub-proof).\n",

    "4. IMPORTANT EXAM TIPS FROM THE LECTURER\n",
    "The lecturer was very specific about how you will be graded on Natural Deduction\n",
    "questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "TIP 1: THE \"BOX\" IS A SCOPE\n",
    "   - RULE: Whatever you derive inside a box STAYS INSIDE THE BOX.\n",
    "   - WHY: The statements inside are only true under the temporary assumption \n",
    "     (e.g., \"Assume $p$\"). Once you close the box, you are no longer assuming\n",
    "     $p$, so you cannot use those lines anymore.\n",
    "   - EXAM WARNING: \"If at any poiint... you derived an extra fact [inside],\n",
    "     you cannot use it later... Anything that doesn't follow this structure\n",
    "     would be marked down.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "TIP 2: LINE NUMBERS\n",
    "   - RULE: Every single line must be numbered.\n",
    "   - CITATION: When you write a rule (e.g., $\\wedge I$), you MUST list the line\n",
    "     numbers you used (e.g., $\\wedge I(1, 3)$).\n",
    "   - ADVICE: \"If you do follow an order [consecutive numbers], it's much better\n",
    "     for clarity.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "TIP 3: JUSTIFICATION\n",
    "   - You must write the rule name (e.g., $\\rightarrow E$) next to every derived\n",
    "     line. You cannot just write the formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "TIP 4: \"ASSUME\" vs \"PREMISES\"\n",
    "   - PREMISES: These are facts given to you at the start (global truth). You \n",
    "     write them at the top.\n",
    "   - ASSUMPTIONS: These are temporary tools used only to start a sub-proof box. \n",
    "     You write them as the first line of a box.\n",
    "     \n",
