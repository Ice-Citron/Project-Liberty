    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. THE PROBLEM: PROPOSITIONAL LOGIC is \"Low Resolution\" (S3)\n",
    "\n",
    "   Up until now, we treated a sentence like \"The list is ordered\" as a single\n",
    "   dot: $p$. But this is too simple. It breaks when we need to reason about the\n",
    "   internal structure of the sentence.\n",

    "      - PREMISE: \"A horse is an animal.\"\n",
    "      - CONCLUSION: \"Therefore, the head of a horse is the head of an animal.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   In Propositional Logic, this looks like:\n",
    "      - Premise: $p$\n",
    "      - Conclusion: $q$\n",
    "      - RESULT: Invalid argument ($p$ does not imply $q$)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   WHY WE NEED FOL: We need a logic that can look inside the sentence to see\n",
    "   that \"Horse\" and \"Animal\" are related objects, and \"Head of\" is a \n",
    "   relationship between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<<<<>>>>\n",
    "2. THE SOLUTION: \"PREDICATE LOGIC IN A NUTSHELL\" (S4)\n",
    "\n",
    "   We stop looking at True/False atoms. Instead, we look at a \"world\" populated\n",
    "   by OBJECTS and the RELATIONSHIPS between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   THE 6 NEW FEATURES (The Toolkit): \n",
    "   To describe this world, we need 6 new syntactic tools:\n",
    "      1. PREDICATES: Properties or Relations (e.g., `Sister`, `is_red`)\n",
    "      2. CONSTANTS: Specific names for objects (e.g., `bob`, `london`)\n",
    "      3. VARIABLES: Placeholders for unknown objects (e.g., $x, y, z$).\n",
    "      4. QUANTIFIERS: Words that count objects ($\\forall, \\exists$)\n",
    "      5. FUNCTIONS: Transformations (e.g., `father_of(bob)` returns a new \n",
    "         person).\n",
    "      6. EQUALITY: Checking if two things are the same ($=$).\n",
    "\n",

    "3. SPLITTING THE ATOM (S6)\n",
    "   This is how we rewrite our basic sentences (Atomic Formulas).\n",
    "\n",
    "   - CONSTANTS: These are proper nouns.\n",
    "      - Example: `aaron`, `russell`\n",
    "   - PREDICATES: These are the \"template\" of the sentence.\n",
    "      - UNARY (1-argument): Describes a property.\n",
    "         - English: \"Aaron is a student.\"\n",
    "         - Logic: `Student(Aaron)`\n",
    "      - BINARY (2-argument): Describes a relationship/\n",
    "         - English: \"Aaron and Russel are friends.\"\n",
    "         - Logic: `Friends(aaron, russell)`               \n",

    "   THE EXAMPLE: \n",

    "\n",
    "In Propositional Logic, we could only talk about specific facts. Now we can talk \n",
    "about GROUPS of things using variables $(x, y, z)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "THE QUANTIFIERS\n",
    "   - $\\forall$ (UNIVERSAL): \"For all\", \"Every\"\n",
    "      - Example: $\\forall x Student(x) \\rightarrow$ \"Everyone is a student.\"\n",
    "   - $\\exists$ (EXISTENTIAL): \"There exists\", \"Some\", \"At least one\"\n",
    "      - Example: $\\exists x Student(x) \\rightarrow$ \"Someone is a student.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "COMPLEX TRANSLATION EXAMPLE\n",
    "   Sentence: \"Frank has a student friend.\"\n",
    "   - LOGIC: $\\exists x (Student(x) \\wedge Friend(frank, x))$\n",
    "   - TRACE:\n",
    "      1. $\\exists x$: \"There is a person $x$...\"\n",
    "      2. $Student(x)$: \"... such that $x$ is a student...\"\n",
    "      3. $\\wedge$: \"... AND ...\"\n",
    "      4. $Friend(frank, x)$: \"...$x$ is a friend of Frank.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. THE \"OBJECT MAKERS\": FUNCTIONS (S11)\n",
    "   This is where students often get confused.\n",
    "   - Predicate (Uppercase): Returns TRUE/FALSE.\n",
    "      - `Father(bob, frank)` $\\rightarrow$ \"Is Bob the father of Frank?\" (Yes/No)\n",
    "   - Function (Lowercase): Returns an OBJECT (a person, a number).\n",
    "      - `father_of(frank)` $\\rightarrow$ This evaluates to THE ACTUAL PERSON who\n",
    "        is Frank's dad. It is not True or False; it is a \"Noun\".\n",

    "                <---- FUNCTION returns an OBJECT\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ARITHMETIC ANALOGY:\n",
    "   - $\\plus$ is a function: 2 + 3 evaluate to $5$. (an object/number)\n",
    "   - $<$ is a predicate: $2 < 3$ evaluates to True.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. EQUALITY (S12)\n",
    "   The symbol $=$ is a special PREDICATE.\n",

    "   - $t_1 = t_2$\n",
    "   - Meaning: \"The object named $t_1$ is the exact same object as $t_2$.\"\n",

    "     function is the same person as the constant on the right).\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. THE \"DICTIONARY\": Signatures\n",
    "   Before we write logic, we must define our vocabulary. This is called the \n",
    "   SIGNATURE $(L)$. It lists the symbols we are allowed to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "   CONVENTION:\n",
    "      - Constants/Functions: Start with LOWERCASE (`frank`, `father_of`).\n",

    "\n",

    "5. THE CORE GRAMMAR: TERMS vs. FORMULAS (Crucial)\n",

    "\n",
    "   A. TERMS (Def 1.1 - S15)\n",
    "      \"Terms name objects.\" They are the NOUNS of the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "      - RULES:\n",
    "         1. Any CONSTANT is a term (`frank`).\n",
    "         2. Any VARIABLE is a term ($x$).\n",
    "         3. Any FUNCTION applied to terms is a term (`father_of(frank)`)\n",
    "      \n",
    "      - RECURSIVE EXAMPLE: `mother_of(father_of(susan))` is a term. It refers to\n",
    "        a specific grandmother.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   B. FORMULAS (Def 1.2 - S16)\n",
    "      \"FORMULAS EXPRESS TRUTHS.\" They are the SENTENCES.\n",
    "\n",
    "      - RULES:\n",
    "         1. ATOMIC FORMULA: A Predicate applied to terms $(P(t_1, t_2))$.\n",
    "            - `Human(frank)` $\\rightarrow$ Formula.\n",
    "            - `Human(father_of(frank))` $\\rightarrow$ Formula.\n",
    "         2. EQUALITY: $t_1 = t_2$ is a Formula.\n",
    "         3. COMPLEX FORMULAS: Created using $\\wedge, \\vee, \\rightarrow, \\neg$\n",
    "            $, \\forall, \\exists$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "THE \"IS IT VALID?\" TEST:\n",
    "   - `Father(frank)`: INVALID (assuming Father is a function). A function by\n",
    "     itself is a Term (Noun), not a Formula (Sentence). It's just \"Frank's dad\".\n",
    "     It doesn't say anything about him.\n",
    "   - `Human(father_of(frank))`: VALID FORMULA. \"Frank's dad is human.\"\n",
    "   - `Human(Human(frank))`: INVALID. Predicates expect Terms (Objects) inside\n",
    "     them. You put a Formula (True/False) inside a Predicate. You can't say\n",
    "     \"Is 'Frank is Human' Human?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. SCOPE AND SENTENCES (S17)\n",
    "   - SCOPE: The part of the formula controlled by a quantifier.\n",
    "      - In $\\forall x (Bought(x, y))$, the variable $x$ is BOUND (controlled by\n",
    "        $\\forall$).\n",
    "      - The variable $y$ is FREE (uncontrolled).\n",
    "\n",
    "   - SENTENCE: A formula with NO free variables:\n",
    "      - $Bought(x, y) \\rightarrow$ Not a sentence (It's an \"Open Formula\").\n",
    "      - $\\forall x \\forall y Bought(x, y) \\rightarrow$ Sentence (Everything is\n",
    "        bound)...\n",
    "\n",
    "   WHY THIS MATTERS: Only SENTENCES can be definitively True or False. If a \n",
    "   variable is free ($x$), we don't know who $x$ is, so we can't say if it's \n",
    "   true."

    "\n",
    "1. SYNTAX & BRACKETS (Crucial)\n",
    "   - TIP: You MUST use brackets to define the scope of your quantifier.\n",
    "   - QUOTE: \"If I had $\\forall x$ lecturer... without brackets... it would be\n",
    "     very hard to read.\"\n",
    "   - EXAM RULE: Always write $\\forall x (Predicate(x))$ rather than \n",
    "     $\\forall x Predicate(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. DIAGRAM \"SANITY\"\n",
    "   - TIP: Do not overthink the \"realism\" of the model.\n",
    "   - CONTEXT: In the lecture, students were confused why one dot represented \n",
    "     both \"Tony\" and \"Susan\" in a specific example, or why \"Lecturers\" weren't\n",
    "     \"Humans\" in another.\n",
    "   - QUOTE: \"The interpretation is arbitrary... It doesn't have to follow common\n",
    "     sense.\"\n",
    "   - EXAM RULE: Believe the diagram/math, even if it says \"The lecturer is a PC.\n",
    "     \" If the diagram says $I(Lecturer) = {o_10}$ and $o_10$ is a PC, then the\n",
    "     lecturer is a PC.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. \"PEDAGOGICAL TOOL\" WARNING\n",
    "   - TIP: The lecturer clarified that these arrow diagrams are just learning \n",
    "     tools.\n",
    "   - QUOTE: \"You will most likely never use this in your life... It's just a \n",
    "     pedagogical tool.\"\n",
    "   - EXAM IMPLICATION; Expect simple questions asking you to \"inspect\" a diagram\n",
    "     (like the exercises above) for easy marks, but don't expect to use this\n",
    "     method for complex proofs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. TERMINOLOGY: SENTENCE vs. FORMULA\n",
    "   - TIP: Know the difference for definitions.\n",
    "   - DEFINITION: A SENTENCE is a formula with NO free variables (all variables\n",
    "     are locked inside a quantifier).\n",
    "   - QUOTE: \"A sentence is a formula where all variables are within the scope\n",
    "     of a quantifier.\"         \n",
