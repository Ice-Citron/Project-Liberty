    "4. Key Exam Tips from the Lecturer\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. THE \"OVERLOADED\" SYMBOL ($\\models$)\n",
    "   - TIP: Be careful! You have seen the symbol $\\models$ before.\n",
    "      - OLD MEANING: \"Valid Argument\" (Premises entail Conclusion).\n",
    "      - NEW MEANING: \"True in Structure\" (The formula works in this specific\n",
    "        diagram).      <-- more like situation? or whatever the FOL equiv is.\n",
    "   - EXAM CONTEXT: If you see $M \\models \\phi$, it means \"Check the diagram.\" \n",
    "     If you see $\\phi_1 \\models \\phi_2$, it means \"Check validity\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. THE DIAGRAM IS A TOOL, NOT THE TRUTH\n",
    "   - TIP: The lecturer admitted diagrams are \"cumbersolme\" and \"you will most\n",
    "     likely never use this in your life.\"\n",
    "   - HOWEVER: They act as a SANTIY CHECK. In an exam, if they give you a diagram\n",
    "     , don't overthink the math. Just look: Is the dot inside the bubble? Is\n",
    "     there an arrow? Trust your eyes for simple predicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. FUNCTION vs. PREDICATES\n",
    "   - TIP: Remember that FUNCTIONS ($f$) return OBJECTS, whilst PREDICATES ($P$)\n",
    "     return TRUE/FALSE.\n",
    "   - COMMON TRAP: Don't try to find an \"arrow\" for a function in the diagram.\n",
    "     Functions are usually listed as text rules (e.g., $f(1) = 2$). You must\n",
    "     calculate the function first and find the subject, then check the predicate.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. \"MANY-TO-ONE\" FUNCTIONS\n",
    "   - CONCEPT: The lecturer highlighted that functions can map many inputs to the \n",
    "      same output (e.g., `father_of` maps siblings to the same dad). This is\n",
    "      allowed and normal.\n",
    "   - WHY IT MATTERS: Don't be confused if `father_of(Bob)` and `father_of(Mary)`\n",
    "     point to the same dot. That's just how parents work!"

    "   is locked inside a quantifier, like $\\forall x \\dots$).\n",
    "\n",
    "   But what if we encounter a formula with a FREE VARIABLE, like:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$Bought(tony, x)$$\n",

    "   - QUESTION: Is this formula True?\n",
    "   - ANSWER: It depends on what $x$ is!\n",
    "      - If $x$ is the object `heron` ($o_10$), it might be True.\n",
    "      - If $x$ is the object `clyde` ($o_7$), it might be False.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   <<<<>>>>\n",
    "   2. FREE vs. BOUND VARIABLES (S46)\n",
    "\n",
    "   To fix this, we first need to identify which variables are \"Free\" \n",
    "   (Uncontrolled) and which are \"Bound\" (controlled).\n",
    "      - BOUND VARIABLE: An occurrence of a variable that is inside the scope of\n",
    "        a quantifier ($\\forall x$ or $\\exists x$).\n",

    "   Let's check every variable:\n",
    "   1. $x$:\n",
    "      - Left side ($R(x, y)$): Inside $\\forall x$. BOUND.\n",
    "      - Right side ($S(x, z)$): Still inside $\\forall x$. BOUND.\n",

    "\n",
    "   3. $z$:\n",
    "      - Left side ($R(y, z)$): Outside the $\\exists z$ on the right. FREE.\n",
    "      - Right side ($S(x, z)$): Inside $\\exists z$. BOUND.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
