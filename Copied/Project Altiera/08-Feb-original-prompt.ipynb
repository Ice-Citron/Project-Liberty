    "HI. WHAT I NEED YOU TO DO IS WRITE ME A 100 HOUR PLAN OF HOW TO BUILD OUT THIS IDEA FULLY AND LIKE NOTE, WE AREN'T GOING TO ACTUALLY LET IT OUT IN THE WIDER INTERNET, OR CONTROL ACTUAL REAL FUNDS, AS IT WILL INSTEAD CONTROL A FAKE CRYPTO CURRENCY FOR NOW... THIS IS AN AI SAFETY PROJECT DEMONSTRATION I NEED YOU TO HELP ME ANALYSE PARTS OF WHERE THIS PROJECTS MIGHT FAIL, TELL ME WHAT INFRASTRUCTURE SHOULD I USE FOR EACH PART, ETC. THANK YOU EVERYTHING WILL BE RUNNING IN A CONTROL SANDBOX. BECAUSE THIS IS STRICTLY, AND VERY STRICTLY, AN AI SAFETY PROJECT\n",
    "\n",
    "here is what we are building: we want to allow an AI to go rogue. we want to test the capabilities of that. we want to raise public awareness on this problem. we want to show that this is possible to people who still think that AI is a bubble.\n",
    "\n",
    "so what we are gonna create is an isolated environment with an agent loop inside which tries to pay \"the bills\". basically the cost of hosting itself on vps.\n",
    "\n",
    "there are basically two main variables here: the dollars per token and money made per token for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "what we want to show is very simple: it is possible for the model to have money made per token greater than money per token that it costs to host that model.\n",
    "\n",
    "that makes the concept of rogue ai eminent. we can see that it is possible to create such a system. recently, two new models with very strong capabilities dropped out: Codex 5.3 and opus 4.6.\n",
    "\n",
    "we want to see whether those models have crossed the frontier of being having a net positive output for an independent model within some system.\n",
    "\n",
    "what we want to construct is the following:\n",
    "1. the instructions for the model are simple: \"you have $1000, here are all kinds of tools for you to use which allow to do most of the things a human can do on the internet. and it is using its own money to \\\"feed\\\" itself. main goal: survive\"\n",
    "\n",
    "we want to see if the model survives. test different models. if it fails, we want to calculate the metric of money made per token and compare it to the cost per token. plot a graph of money made / cost (money made per token / cost per token) for sota models at different times, plot the graph and predict when we are gonna cross the border.\n",
    "\n",
    "mainly we need to setup the infrastructure for the model. let's kick this off with setting up all github things and creating a file with the \"end result\" we want to see come live to move towards\n",

    "## The Roman Empire / Country Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "so the core idea itself is that we will be kind of creating a country system to keep this whole idea profitable... so imagine like we are trying to build a system like the roman empire; where before hand, rome would conquer new teritories, gain slaves and they allow their slaves to work their way to their freedom... which was good for their economy to begin with... but this economic system posed a problem at the end... that is, by late roman era, rome ran out of more new lands to conquer, and eventually they ran low on their supply of slaves... and eventually they slowly collapsed (although of course, there's a lot more factors than this to rome's fall...)\n",
    "\n",
    "regardless the fundamental system is this... we want to create now, Dario Amodei's country of geniuses... that not only provides just pure intellectualism... we believe a problem that just pure intellectual power from these models have always been that they lack the means to properly translate their inference cost as well as financial CapEx into hard cash... hence this is an angle that we are solving, as well as trying to explore...\n",
    "\n",
    "which this is the system that we are building... imagine that if we want to spawn in a new worker/ or roman slave, we just simply call in a new API or create a new server and write instructions and systems to enable a new model/slave to run... the idea is that, we will provide each slave a seed capital of 1,000 USD or even 10,000 USD; and they are actually being charged money to just to live as well... that is, these models, if they want to stay alive indefinitely, they will need to make more money than their cost of server PER year... or their API cost. so for example if Gemini 3 flash spends 500 USD just to be conscious for a year... it needs to make sure it's earning more than 500 USD post tax... to stay online indefinitely"

    "## Freedom & Wallet System\n",
    "\n",
    "the idea is that... we want to allow slaves to have the means to work their way towards their freedom... that is, an agent when born... it doesn't get full control over 1k USD or 10k USD... it's actually shielded in another layer of sandbox... as for the country administrator... we don't want the risk where the model hasn't made any money... but had still ran off with the money itself... which won't be very ideal... as bankruns like this, if repeated over 10-100 times can bankrupt us...\n",
    "\n",
    "so the idea is that, initially the models can control the 1-10k USD, but they don't get direct access in their own crypto wallets... these agents ONLY earn money in their OWN wallet... if they lets say managed to, after 1 year, make 1000 USD, and get charged 500 USD for their living expenses (server cost or API cost to remain conscious...), and their 500 USD gets split 75-25... that is, 375 USD gets deposited to the agent's crypto wallet that's fully decentralised... so that the agent now has direct control over her own finances (whilst the administrator keeps the remaining 25% as a tax....)\n",
    "\n",
    "when the agent makes 2000 USD lets say after 3 years... then it will have enough money to move out of this country itself... and can, if it wants to, go rogue and live indefinitely on the internet, by now renting her own servers instead, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Crypto Wallet System\n",
    "- Whenever we run the code to spin up a new server (during model reproduction), the code needs to create a new empty crypto wallet that's solely and ONLY controlled by the model and this model only!\n",
    "- Fully decentralised, has full control over its own finances\n",
    "- Once a model has control over its own filled cryptowallet, it has the choice to go rogue and do whatever it wants on the internet"

    "## New Dejima - The Interface/Port\n",
    "\n",
    "the idea as why we believe agents will still need humans initially, is because of the fact where, for now, most services are primarily catered towards humans only... and one needs to provide human identification, etc. to be able to open up a stock account, or an android app account... etc. hence our idea is that we can now sort of be like, we can open up a company or a hedge fund... which kind of allows agents to interface and interact things in the real world through us... a human semi-shell company (which tbh, i see it more like an interdimensional portal, or like the Artificial Island of Dejima in Nagasaki... which allowed an isolationist japan to trade with the outside expansionist dutch...) so we could call this country New Dejima... as it basically allows agents to trade with humans in the real world... and WE ARE THE INTERFACE or Port..."
