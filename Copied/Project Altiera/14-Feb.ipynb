    "         immediately when specific events occur, such as incoming messages from\n",
    "         connected apps (WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack), or when internal state \n",
    "         changes.\n",
    "       - EVENT TYPES: Agents can subscribe to various event types handled by the\n",
    "         Gateway, including `agent`, `presence`, `health` and `tick` (time-based\n",
    "         heartbeats).\n",

    "- Handlers in the backend are functions or classes designed to process incoming\n",
    "  requests (HTTP, events, etc.), execute buisness logic, and return a response.\n",
    "  They act as intermediaries between raw ssytem events or API endpoints and the\n",
    "  core application logic, often managing data retrieval, validation and security\n",
    "  tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Key aspects of handlers in backend development:\n",
    "  - HTTP REQUEST HANDLING: Web handlers receive a request object (URLs, headers)\n",

    "  - EVENT HANDLING: In event-driven architectures, handlers (or consumers) \n",
    "    respond to specific events, such as processing data from a queue or a \n",
    "    database change.\n",
    "  - PROCESS FLOW: A handler typically follows a structured path: \n",
    "     receive request --> validate data --> interact with db/models --> return response\n",
    "  - TYPES OF HANDLERS:\n",
    "      - PIPE HANDLERS: Common in monitoring systems (like Sensu) to process\n",
    "        incoming events via scripts.\n",
    "      - WEB SERVICE HANDLERS: Used to handle SOAP or REST API requests, often\n",
    "        managing headers and endpoints.\n",
    "      - DEFAULT HANDLERS: Built-in server functions that handle static content\n",
    "        or default file requests.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  In short, a handler is a specialised function that \"handles\" a particular\n",
    "  input to ensure the application reacts correctly to external requests or \n",
