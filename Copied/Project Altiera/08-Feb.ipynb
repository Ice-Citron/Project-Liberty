    "S1: What OpenClaw is\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenClaw is an FOSS, self-hosted AI gateway and personal assistant framework. \n",
    "Think of it as a local WebSocket server that sits in the middle between:\n",
    "   - Messaging Platforms\n",
    "   - AI agents\n",
    "\n",
    "It gives agents the ability to:\n",
    "   - Receive and send messages across any chat platform\n",
    "   - Execute tools (browser automation, bash commands, file operations, memory\n",
    "     search)\n",
    "   - Manage sessions and long-term memory\n",
    "   - Run inside sandboxed Docker containers\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "WHY THIS MATTERS FOR YOUR PROJECT: OpenClaw is essentially a working blueprint\n",
    "for giving an AI agent the infrastructure to operate semi-autonomously across\n",
    "multiple channels. It has the tool system, session persistence, multi-provider\n",

    "      - `MEMORY./md` or `memory.md` in the agent's workspace root\n",
    "      - All `*.md` files inside a `memory/` directory\n",
    "      - Optional extra paths you configure\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. SESSION TRANSCRIPTS (`source: \"sessions\"`)   \n",
    "      - JSONL files at `~/.openclaw/sessions/<agentId>/<sessionId>.jsonl`\n",
    "      - Each line in the JSONL is a JSON record with type: \"message\" and a \n",
    "        message containing role (user/assistant) and `content`\n",
    "      - The system parses these, extracts text, redacts sensitive content, and\n",
    "        converts them into searchable markdown format: `User: <text> / Assistant: <text>`\n",
    "\n",
    "      This is the key insight: conversations become searchable memory. Every \n",

    "   - Takes raw markdown content and splits it into `chunks` based on a token\n",
    "     budget\n",
    "   - Each chunk has: `startLine`, `endLine`, `text`, and a SHA-256 `hash`\n",
    "   - Chunking uses a SLIDING WINDOW WITH OVERLAP - when a chunk fills up, it\n",
    "     carries over some lines from the end to the start of the next chunk \n",
    "     (overlap)  \n",

    "   - Overlap: `overlapChars = overlap * 4`\n",
    "\n",
    "   This is similar to what you'd see in LangChain's text spliiters but \n",

    "  4. Cleans up stale entries (files that no longer exist)\n",
    "  5. Uses batched embedding with configurable concurrency (default: 4 parallel tasks)\n",

    "\n",
    "  Batch Processing (batch-voyage.ts, batch-openai.ts, batch-gemini.ts):\n",

    "  - The QmdMemoryManager class wraps QMD CLI commands: qmd collection add, qmd update, qmd embed, qmd query\n",

    "\n",
    "  For your agents' consciousness loop, here's what you'd adapt:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Session-as-memory: Every action your agent takes gets stored as a JSONL transcript. When the agent\n",
    "  wakes up from hibernation, it can search its own history to remember what it was doing. This IS the\n",
    "  \"auto-compaction and RAG graph\" from your design.\n",
    "  2. The hybrid search is crucial: Your agents need to find both semantically related memories (\"what was I\n",
    "   working on related to making money?\") AND exact matches (\"what was the Stripe API key I used?\"). Pure\n",
    "  vector search would miss the second case.\n",
    "  3. The local embedding option matters for cost: If your agents are trying to be cost-efficient, using the\n",
    "   300M GGUF model locally for embeddings instead of paying for OpenAI embedding API calls could save\n",
    "  significant money at scale.\n",
    "  4. The delta detection pattern: You don't re-embed everything every time. You only re-embed what changed.\n",
    "   This is critical for agents that run for weeks - you can't afford to re-process all memory on every wake\n",
    "   cycle.\n",
    "  5. The scope system: QMD's scope-based access control (deny memory search in group chats, allow in direct\n",
    "   messages) maps directly to your agent permission model - different contexts get different memory access\n",
    "  levels.\n",
