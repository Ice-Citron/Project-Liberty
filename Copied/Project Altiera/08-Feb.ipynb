    "S1: What OpenClaw is\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenClaw is an FOSS, self-hosted AI gateway and personal assistant framework. \n",
    "Think of it as a local WebSocket server that sits in the middle between:\n",
    "   - Messaging Platforms\n",
    "   - AI agents\n",
    "\n",
    "It gives agents the ability to:\n",
    "   - Receive and send messages across any chat platform\n",
    "   - Execute tools (browser automation, bash commands, file operations, memory\n",
    "     search)\n",
    "   - Manage sessions and long-term memory\n",
    "   - Run inside sandboxed Docker containers\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "WHY THIS MATTERS FOR YOUR PROJECT: OpenClaw is essentially a working blueprint\n",
    "for giving an AI agent the infrastructure to operate semi-autonomously across\n",
    "multiple channels. It has the tool system, session persistence, multi-provider\n",
    "support, and plugin architecture that your \"New Dejima\" agents would need.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "SECTION 2: THE ENTRY POINT & HOW IT WORKS\n",
    "\n",
    "The boot chain is simple:\n",
    "   openclaw.mjs -> dist/entry.js -> src/index.ts -> CLI program (Commander.js)\n",
    "\n",
    "- openclaw.mjs - The file you run. It just loads the compiled distribution.\n",
    "- src/index.ts - Builds the CLI command tree using Commander.js with 100+\n",
    "  command handlers.\n",
    "- The main command is `gateway` which starts the WebSocket control plane on port\n",
    "  18789.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "WHY THIS MATTERS FOR YOU: Your agent loop system needs an entry point like this.\n",
    "When an agent \"Wakes up\", something needs to bootstrap the environment, load\n",
    "tools, and start the main loop. OpenClaw's boot chain is a clean reference for\n",
    "that.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "SECTION 3: THE GATEWAY (`src/gateway/`, ~130 files)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the BRAIN of OpenClaw. The Gateway is a WebSocket server that handles:\n",
    "   - SESSION MANAGEMENT - Each conversation gets an isolated session (main\n",
    "     sessions for 1-on-1, group sessions for groups)\n",
    "   - CHANNEL ROUTING - Incoming messages get routed to the right agent based on\n",
    "     rules.\n",
    "   - CLIENT MANAGEMENT - WebSocket connection lifecycle, authentication.\n",
    "   - CONFIGURATION - Config reloading, state persistence\n",
    "   - PRESENCE & TYPING - Real-time status indicators\n",
    "   - AGENT INTEGRATION - Connects to the Pi agent via RPC.\n",
    "\n",
    "WHY THIS MATTERS: Your agent consciousness loop needs soemthing like this \n",
    "   Gateway. it's the central control plane that coordinates everything. Your \n",
    "   agent needs a persistent process that manages their state, routes their \n",
    "   actions, and coordinates their tool usage."
