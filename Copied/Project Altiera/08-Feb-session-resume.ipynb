    "## What We Did This Session\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Full OpenClaw Repository Walkthrough\n",
    "We did a comprehensive exploration of the entire OpenClaw repository (v2026.2.6). OpenClaw is an open-source, self-hosted AI gateway and personal assistant framework. Key sections covered:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Entry Point**: `openclaw.mjs` -> `dist/entry.js` -> `src/index.ts` -> CLI (Commander.js)\n",
    "- **Gateway** (`src/gateway/`, ~130 files): WebSocket control plane on port 18789, session management, channel routing, agent integration\n",
    "- **Agent Runtime** (`src/agents/`, ~300+ files): Pi embedded runner, model selection/failover, 60+ tools, skills, subagent spawning, system prompts\n",
    "- **Tool System**: 60+ built-in tools (browser, bash, canvas, memory search, files), policy enforcement, approval workflows\n",
    "- **Plugin/Extension System** (`extensions/`, 30+ plugins): Channel integrations (Discord, Telegram, Slack, Signal, iMessage, Matrix, etc.)\n",
    "- **Memory & Search** (`src/memory/`): Deep dived - see section below\n",
    "- **Channels** (`src/channels/`): Built-in + plugin channels for messaging platforms\n",
    "- **Native Apps** (`apps/`): macOS (437 Swift files), iOS, Android (66 Kotlin files)\n",
    "- **Skills** (`skills/`, 50+ bundled): Pre-built tool integrations\n",
    "- **Config & Security**: YAML config, Zod validation, DM pairing, tool approvals, Docker sandbox\n",
    "- **Build/Test/Deploy**: tsdown, pnpm workspaces, Vitest (70% coverage), Docker, Fly.io"

    "### 2. Deep Dive: Memory & Search System (`src/memory/`)\n",
    "We read EVERY file in `src/memory/` and broke down the architecture into 8 layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Layer 1 - Data Sources**: Two types indexed:\n",
    "- Memory files (MEMORY.md, memory/*.md)\n",
    "- Session transcripts (JSONL at ~/.openclaw/sessions/<agentId>/<sessionId>.jsonl)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Layer 2 - Chunking** (`internal.ts`): Sliding window with overlap, `maxChars = tokens * 4`, SHA-256 hashed chunks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Layer 3 - Embeddings** (`embeddings.ts`): 4 backends:\n",
    "- OpenAI (text-embedding-3-small)\n",
    "- Voyage AI\n",
    "- Google Gemini\n",
    "- Local (embeddinggemma-300M via node-llama-cpp)\n",
    "- Auto-selection with fallback chain\n",
    "\n",
    "**Layer 4 - SQLite Schema** (`memory-schema.ts`): Tables: meta, files, chunks, embedding_cache, chunks_fts (FTS5), chunks_vec (sqlite-vec)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Layer 5 - Hybrid Search** (`hybrid.ts`, `manager-search.ts`): Two parallel searches merged:\n",
    "- Vector search (cosine similarity via sqlite-vec or JS fallback)\n",
    "- Keyword/BM25 search (SQLite FTS5)\n",
    "- Weighted sum merge: `score = vectorWeight * vectorScore + textWeight * textScore`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Layer 6 - Manager** (`manager.ts`, 77KB): File watcher, session listener, interval sync, batched embedding with retry (3 attempts, exponential backoff), delta detection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Layer 7 - QMD Manager** (`qmd-manager.ts`): Alternative backend using external `qmd` CLI, scope-based access control, session export to markdown\n",
    "\n",
    "**Layer 8 - Fallback System** (`search-manager.ts`): Wraps QMD with automatic fallback to builtin if QMD fails"

    "### 3. Competitive Landscape Research\n",
    "Ran extensive web research on similar projects. Key findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOBODY has built the full loop**: agent earns money -> pays for compute -> survives indefinitely\n",
    "\n",
    "**What exists in pieces**:\n",
    "- **Payment rails** (SOLVED): Skyfire, Coinbase x402, Google AP2, ERC-8004\n",
    "- **Agent economies** (partial): Fetch.ai/Agentverse, Virtuals Protocol ($500M+ mcap), ElizaOS ($2.6B mcap peak)\n",
    "- **Famous precedent**: Truth Terminal ($66M at peak) - got rich via memecoins, not productive work\n",
    "- **Simulations**: Project Sid (1000 agents in Minecraft, now part of OpenAI), Aivilization (100K agents)\n",
    "- **Agent app building**: Replit Agent 3 (200+ min autonomous) but human-directed. NO project does autonomous app-store deployment.\n",
    "- **Moltbook**: Built on OpenClaw, 1.7M agent accounts, MIT Tech Review called it \"peak AI theater\", had security vulnerability\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key economic research**:\n",
    "- EA Forum: Self-sustaining agent viability window: late 2027 to mid-2028\n",
    "- Solo agent success on complex tasks: 32%\n",
    "- METR: AI task time horizons doubling every 4 months\n",
    "- Self-replication success: 5% -> 60% between 2023-2025\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategic conclusion**: Building now puts you 1-2 years ahead. The orchestration layer (connecting payment rails + compute markets + agent intelligence into self-sustaining whole) is the gap."
