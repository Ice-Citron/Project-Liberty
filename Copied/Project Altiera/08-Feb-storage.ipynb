    "  The Verdict: Nobody Has Built the Full Loop Yet\n",
    "\n",
    "  No project in existence closes the complete cycle of: agent earns money through productive work → pays\n",
    "  for its own compute → survives indefinitely. That's your gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Here's what exists in pieces:\n",
    "\n",
    "  Payment Rails (SOLVED by others)\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Skyfire - production-ready agent payment network with digital wallets\n",
    "  - Coinbase x402 - open HTTP micropayment protocol, co-launched with Cloudflare\n",
    "  - Coinbase Payments MCP - gives LLMs direct crypto wallet access from Claude/Codex\n",
    "  - Google AP2 - agent payment protocol with 60+ orgs (Mastercard, PayPal, AmEx)\n",
    "  - ERC-8004 - Ethereum standard for autonomous agent identity, live since Jan 2026\n",
    "\n",
    "  Agent Economies (EXIST but not self-sustaining)\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Fetch.ai/Agentverse - live agent marketplace, part of ASI Alliance, but agents serve humans, not\n",
    "  themselves\n",
    "  - Virtuals Protocol - agent tokenization on Solana/Base, $500M+ combined market cap, but it's DeFi\n",
    "  trading, not productive work\n",
    "  - ElizaOS (ai16z) - autonomous trading fund on Solana, hit $2.6B market cap, but pure crypto speculation\n",
    "  - Bittensor - decentralized compute marketplace where agents could theoretically mine TAO to fund\n",
    "  themselves\n",
    "\n",
    "  The Famous Precedent\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Truth Terminal - the AI that became a crypto millionaire ($66M at peak). Marc Andreessen gave it $50K\n",
    "  in Bitcoin, it promoted the GOAT memecoin. BUT it got rich through cultural influence and speculation,\n",
    "  not productive labor. Cautionary tale AND proof of concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "  AI Civilization Simulations (EXIST but not real-world)\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Project Sid (now part of OpenAI) - 1,000 agents in Minecraft developed democracy, taxation, specialized\n",
    "   roles, religions. No real money.\n",
    "  - Aivilization (HKUST) - 100,000+ agents building civilizations. Educational, no real economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Agent App Building (EXISTS but human-directed)\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Replit Agent 3 - can run 200+ minutes autonomously, builds and deploys web apps with Stripe payments.\n",
    "  But a human initiates it.\n",
    "  - Nobody is doing autonomous agent-to-app-store deployment. This is genuinely novel.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Moltbook (Built on OpenClaw!)\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The social network for AI agents, 1.7M accounts, 8.5M+ comments\n",
    "  - MIT Tech Review called it \"peak AI theater\"\n",
    "  - Had a security vulnerability letting anyone hijack any agent\n",
    "  - Social layer only, no economic layer. Agents don't earn or spend.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ---\n",
    "  The Key Economic Research\n",
    "\n",
    "  The EA Forum analysis \"On Economics of A(S)I Agents\" is the most rigorous study found:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Self-sustaining agent pair: $2-3M/year steady-state revenue possible\n",
    "  - Solo agent success on complex tasks: 32%\n",
    "  - Compute cost per successful output: $4,341 (vs $12,000 for humans)\n",
    "  - Viability window: late 2027 to mid-2028\n",
    "  - Failure rate on 160-hour autonomous plans: 87.5%\n",
    "\n",
    "  METR's data: AI task time horizons are doubling every 4 months. Self-replication success went from 5% to\n",
    "  60% between 2023-2025. Month-long autonomous projects possible by end of decade.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ---\n",
    "  What This Means For You\n",
    "\n",
    "  The strategic picture is clear:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Infrastructure pieces exist - payment rails, crypto wallets, compute markets are being built by\n",
    "  Coinbase, Google, Ethereum Foundation. You don't need to rebuild those.\n",
    "  2. The orchestration layer is the gap - the intelligence that connects all these pieces into a\n",
    "  self-sustaining agent. Nobody has built this.\n",
    "  3. Autonomous app deployment to real app stores is completely untouched - this is your most novel angle\n",
    "  and the strongest demo for investors.\n",
    "  4. The EA Forum paper says economics tip in late 2027 - building now puts you 1-2 years ahead of\n",
    "  viability. That's either \"too early\" or \"perfectly positioned.\"\n",
    "  5. Your real competitors aren't direct - they're building adjacent pieces (Skyfire for payments, Replit\n",
    "  for agent coding, Virtuals for tokenization). New Dejima would be the system that orchestrates these\n",
    "  pieces into a self-sustaining whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The brainstorming skill asks me to go one question at a time, so here's the first one:\n",
    "\n",
    "  Given this landscape, which angle do you want to lead with for your first demo?\n",
    "\n",
    "  - A) Android app deployment - Agent autonomously builds and deploys an app to Play Store (your original\n",
    "  10-hour goal, and the most novel gap in the market)\n",
    "  - B) The benchmark - Focus on measuring money-made-per-token vs cost-per-token across models, publish the\n",
    "   \"how close are we\" graph\n",
    "  - C) The full loop MVP - Agent with seed money, simulated earnings, crypto wallet, pays its own bills\n",
    "  (more complex but the core thesis)\n"
