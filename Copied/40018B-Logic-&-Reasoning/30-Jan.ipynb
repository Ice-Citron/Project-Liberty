    "      - INSIDE THE BARS ($\\phi$): This is called a PROPOSITIONAL FORMULA (or\n",
    "        just \"formula\"). It is the code/script you want to run. It consists of\n",
    "        ATOMS ($p, q$) connected by CONNECTIVES ($\\wedge, \\vee, \\rightarrow$).\n",
    "      - THE SUBSCRIPT ($v$): This is the VALUATION (or \"Model\" or \"State\"). It \n",

    "        variables.\n",

    "      - THE OUTPUT (`tt`): This is the return value. `tt` stands for \"Truth\" (boolean `True`).\n",
