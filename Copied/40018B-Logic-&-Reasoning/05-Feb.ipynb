    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. THE PROBLEM: PROPOSITIONAL LOGIC is \"Low Resolution\" (S3)\n",
    "\n",
    "   Up until now, we treated a sentence like \"The list is ordered\" as a single\n",
    "   dot: $p$. But this is too simple. It breaks when we need to reason about the\n",
    "   internal structure of the sentence.\n",

    "      - PREMISE: \"A horse is an animal.\"\n",
    "      - CONCLUSION: \"Therefore, the head of a horse is the head of an animal.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   In Propositional Logic, this looks like:\n",
    "      - Premise: $p$\n",
    "      - Conclusion: $q$\n",
    "      - RESULT: Invalid argument ($p$ does not imply $q$)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   WHY WE NEED FOL: We need a logic that can look inside the sentence to see\n",
    "   that \"Horse\" and \"Animal\" are related objects, and \"Head of\" is a \n",
    "   relationship between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<<<<>>>>\n",
    "2. THE SOLUTION: \"PREDICATE LOGIC IN A NUTSHELL\" (S4)\n",
    "\n",
    "   We stop looking at True/False atoms. Instead, we look at a \"world\" populated\n",
    "   by OBJECTS and the RELATIONSHIPS between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   THE 6 NEW FEATURES (The Toolkit): \n",
    "   To describe this world, we need 6 new syntactic tools:\n",
    "      1. PREDICATES: Properties or Relations (e.g., `Sister`, `is_red`)\n",
    "      2. CONSTANTS: Specific names for objects (e.g., `bob`, `london`)\n",
    "      3. VARIABLES: Placeholders for unknown objects (e.g., $x, y, z$).\n",
    "      4. QUANTIFIERS: Words that count objects ($\\forall, \\exists$)\n",
    "      5. FUNCTIONS: Transformations (e.g., `father_of(bob)` returns a new \n",
    "         person).\n",
    "      6. EQUALITY: Checking if two things are the same ($=$).\n",
    "\n",

    "3. SPLITTING THE ATOM (S6)\n",
    "   This is how we rewrite our basic sentences (Atomic Formulas).\n",
    "\n",
    "   - CONSTANTS: These are proper nouns.\n",
    "      - Example: `aaron`, `russell`\n",
    "   - PREDICATES: These are the \"template\" of the sentence.\n",
    "      - UNARY (1-argument): Describes a property.\n",
    "         - English: \"Aaron is a student.\"\n",
    "         - Logic: `Student(Aaron)`\n",
    "      - BINARY (2-argument): Describes a relationship/\n",
    "         - English: \"Aaron and Russel are friends.\"\n",
    "         - Logic: `Friends(aaron, russell)`               \n",

    "   Writing `Friends(aaron, russell)` is boring. It's just a specific fact. Real\n",

    "   THE EXAMPLE: \n",

    "In Propositional Logic, we could only talk about specific facts. Now we can talk \n",
    "about GROUPS of things using variables $(x, y, z)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "THE QUANTIFIERS\n",
    "   - $\\forall$ (UNIVERSAL): \"For all\", \"Every\"\n",
    "      - Example: $\\forall x Student(x) \\rightarrow$ \"Everyone is a student.\"\n",
    "   - $\\exists$ (EXISTENTIAL): \"There exists\", \"Some\", \"At least one\"\n",
    "      - Example: $\\exists x Student(x) \\rightarrow$ \"Someone is a student.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "COMPLEX TRANSLATION EXAMPLE\n",
    "   Sentence: \"Frank has a student friend.\"\n",
    "   - LOGIC: $\\exists x (Student(x) \\wedge Friend(frank, x))$\n",
    "   - TRACE:\n",
    "      1. $\\exists x$: \"There is a person $x$...\"\n",
    "      2. $Student(x)$: \"... such that $x$ is a student...\"\n",

    "2. THE \"OBJECT MAKERS\": FUNCTIONS (S11)\n",
    "   This is where students often get confused.\n",
    "   - Predicate (Uppercase): Returns TRUE/FALSE.\n",

    "ARITHMETIC ANALOGY:\n",
