    1. I think just focused very heavily on running through PPTs and PPQs... just look at all the techniques used by them and also 
       alternatives ones... and practice by asking claude for example to write out similar ones... SPEED

       -- 2022 is hard
       -- 2025 seem to be about parsers... or state monads

                `nub`
                \case
                [ParseTree]
                split2 and split3.          <-- custom PPQ function... ig we will learn this more in ppq... but pay attention to function re-use...

    2. still don't understand the `commands` and `commands'` functions from bottom of ApplicativeParsing.lhs
            -- A potential concern rn tbf... is that we are very good at implementation of interfaces rn... but not much good at
               actually using these functions and HOFs... but this should be fixable in the next 3 days

    3. need lots of practice with writing `do`... oddly enough they seem to be similar to list-comprehensions... check ed-stem
            -- ask gemini to provide me examples... like to translate LCs to Do and Dos back to LC
