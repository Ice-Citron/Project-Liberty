    "   In REASONING, we use induction to rigorously prove that the recursive code\n",
    "   and the mathematical shortcut will always produce the exact same output. The\n",

    "     derived `Enum`, `Show`, `Eq`, and `Ord`. This is the cleverest part of the\n",
    "     setup. Because `A` is listed first, `fromEnumA` is `0`. `V2` is `1`, \n",

    "     guard `v >= J` evaluates to `10`. For everything else (including an Ace\n",
    "     played `Lo`), `fromEnum v + 1` mathematically maps `A -> 1`, `V2 -> 2`, etc.\n",

    "     accumulating the `cardValue` of each card based on the `hilo` rule.\n",
    "   - `bust` & `lose`: `bust` checks if the calculated integer is strictly \n",
    "     greater than `21`. `lose` is just a wrapper that extracts the `hand` out of\n",
    "     the current `History` wrapper to pass it to `bust`. The game evaluates to\n",
